["index.html", "Data Handyman 1 Preface", " Data Handyman Todd Grabowsky 1 Preface People who write code are a generous bunch. I’m indebted to the countless hackers, bloggers and stackoverflow-ers who prolificly share their code and insights. The goal of this book is to hopefully pay some of those gifts forward (and selfishly, to set aside some time and space to reflect on and reinforce the many things I’ve learned over the years). I am a data scientist by trade1 and my tool of choice tends to be the R statistical programming language. So many, if not most, of the examples in this book use R. There are lots of great software tools out there and it’s worth exploring them as time permits, but I’m sticking with what I know. One quick aside about choosing tools – I believe strongly in the idea of “the right tool for the job at hand”. It’s always good to think deeply about a problem before deciding on a solution. Remember the “law of the instrument”: “if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”. R just happens to be a Swiss Army knife, so I feel good using it in a lot of different situations 😄. “Data Scientist” has become an umbrella term that encompasses many data-oriented professions. As a result, I’ve had the privilege of wearing lots of hats throughout my career thus far, hence “Data Handyman”. Projects ranging from statistical analysis to software architecture, from web scraping to user interface design. There are lots of flavors of data scientists in the same way that there are lots of different types of handymen. Some specialize in plumbing, some in electrical, and some do a little bit of everything.↩ "],
["the-guild.html", "2 The Guild", " 2 The Guild When I was in middle school, my friend taught me to juggle during our tennis unit in PE class. We started with tennis balls and worked our way up to tennis rackets. This same friend and I ended up going to the same university where he became president of the “Juggler’s Guild”. We called ourselves a “guild” because juggling is a craft. I believe that data and coding skills are also a craft. When I say that data/coding is a craft, what I mean is that it’s as much an art as it is science. There’s no single best way to solve any problem, but there are definitely best practices and conventions that have developed over time. These best practices are sometimes passed down in classrooms, but I would argue that they are more often shared through experience. Like other guild crafts, I think the intangible “art” of data and coding makes it conducive to an apprenticeship model (though, of course, there is still a lot that can be learned from books/blogs/articles and in the classroom as well).
